                Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions
                required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.<br>
                This includes the collection, transport, treatment, and disposal of 
                waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management
                process and waste-related laws, technologies, and economic mechanisms.

                Waste can either be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different
                methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types
                of waste, including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic,
                biomedical, radioactive wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to
                human health. Health issues are associated with the entire process of waste 
                management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly: directly 
                through the handling of solid waste, and indirectly through the consumption 
                of water, soil, and food.

                Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable 
                cities, but it remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. 
                A report found that effective waste management is relatively expensive, usually
                comprising 20% to 50% of municipal budgets. Operating this essential municipal
                service requires integrated systems that are efficient, sustainable, and socially
                supported. A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal solid
                waste (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial,
                and commercial activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
                (IPCC), municipal solid waste is expected to reach approximately 3.4 Gigatonnes by 
                2050; however, policies and lawmaking can reduce the amount of waste produced in 
                different areas and cities of the world.

                Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most European countries,
                Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and many other parts of the developed world 
                in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks.</p></pre></center>
                <center><h2>Waste segregation</h2></center>
            <center><pre><p id="waste-management-description-detail1">    
                This is the separation of wet waste and dry waste. The purpose is to recycle dry waste
                easily and to use wet waste as compost. When segregating waste, the amount of waste that
                gets landfilled reduces considerably, resulting in lower levels of air and water pollution.
                Importantly, waste segregation should be based on the type of waste and the most appropriate
                treatment and disposal. This also makes it easier to apply different processes to the waste,
                like composting, recycling, and incineration

            <center><pre><p id="waste-management-description-detail">  
            <b>Landfill: </b>A landfill is a site for the disposal of waste materials. It is the oldest
                         and most common form of waste disposal.
            <b>incineration: </b>Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected
                             to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method
                             is useful for the disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from wa-
                             stewater treatment. This process reduces the volume of solid waste by 80 to 95%.
            <b>Recycle: </b>Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of
                        waste materials such as empty beverage containers. This process involves breaking down 
                        and reusing materials that would otherwise be gotten rid of as trash. 
                        The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans, copper
                        such as wire, steel from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber
                        tyres, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass bottles and jars, paperboard cartons, newspapers,
                         magazines and light paper, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.
