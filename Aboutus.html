        <p><b><u>Our Mission:</u></b><br>
            Our mission is to create a sustainable and compassionate world by reducing food waste and ensuring that surplus food
            is redistributed to those in need. We believe that everyone deserves access to nutritious food, and we are committed
            to making a positive impact on our communities and the environment.<br>
            
            <b><u>Our Vision:</u></b><br>
            Our vision is a world where food waste is a thing of the past, and everyone has access to the food they need to thrive.
            We strive to inspire and empower individuals and organizations to take action against food waste and create a more 
            sustainable future.<br>
            
            <b><u>What We Do:</u></b><br>
            We work to reduce food waste by partnering with food businesses, farms, and households to recover surplus food. We then
            distribute this food to local food banks, shelters, and community organizations that serve those in need. We also provide
            education and outreach programs to raise awareness about the issue of food waste and promote sustainable food practices.<br>
            
            <b><u>Our Values:</u></b><br>
            
                Compassion: We believe in treating everyone with kindness and respect.
                Sustainability: We are committed to protecting the environment and promoting sustainable practices.
                Collaboration: We work together with our partners and communities to achieve our goals.
                Innovation: We are always seeking new and innovative ways to address the issue of food waste.</p><br>
